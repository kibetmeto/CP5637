# Week 8  Learning Experiments

## 1. Making an Observation

This trimester, the subject of CP3402 has been a real stretch for me with a very challenging learning environment. The span of practicals, from basic web design to advanced WordPress customization and PHP, called for quick adaptation and problem-solving at a very fast pace. This has been tiring but has really enabled me to grasp the concepts regarding web development in depth.

## 2. Forming a Hypothesis

I will be more confident in problem-solving and speed when I am within a local development environment to test and debug web applications compared to working directly on a live site. The local environment offers room for experiments and faster iterations without the risks that come with live sites.

## 3. Making a Prediction

I believe that if I use a local development environment for testing and debugging my web applications, I would be better positioned to identify and resolve issues with greater efficiency and effectiveness. This would help in catching errors early, leading to a smoother development process and a higher quality of final output.

## 4. Run an Experiment and Analyze the Results

**Experiment:** I set up a local development environment by using XAMPP to develop and test a simple WordPress site. Most of the efforts were focused on the creation and debugging of custom themes and plugins locally before deployment on a live server.

**Procedure:**
1. Installed XAMPP to create a local server environment on my computer.
2. Set up a local installation of WordPress within XAMPP.
3. Developed a custom theme and a basic plugin for the local WordPress site.
4. Tested and debugged the theme and plugin extensively on the local environment.
5. Documented the issues encountered and the solutions applied during debugging.

**Outcomes:**
- The local development environment allowed me to experiment with code changes quickly without affecting a live site.
- I was able to identify and fix problems with the theme layout and plugin functionality much faster.
- The ability to easily revert changes and test various scenarios improved the overall debugging process.

**Analysis:**
This experiment confirmed that a local development environment significantly enhances problem-solving efficiency. Testing and debugging code without impacting a live site allowed for more thorough experimentation and quicker resolution of issues. It provided valuable assistance in improving the quality of my development workflow and output.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Debugging Efficiency:** It was easier to debug in a local development environment. Changes could be tested and issues fixed without affecting the live site, which greatly improved the effectiveness of my development workflow.
- **Safe Experimentation:** The local environment provided a safe space to experiment with code, allowing me to try new techniques and approaches without the fear of breaking a live site.
- **Improved Problem-Solving:** Hands-on experience with local development enhanced my problem-solving skills and allowed for a more structured approach to debugging and code testing.
